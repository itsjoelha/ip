## 3. Adding Tasks

Monkey supports three types of tasks:

### 3.1 Adding a To-Do

A to-do task is a simple task with no deadline or specific time.

To add a to-do, type: `todo TASK_DESCRIPTION`. For example, `todo Buy toothpaste`.

```
Got it. I've added this task: 
   [T][ ] Buy toothpaste
Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
```
### 3.2 Adding a Deadline

A deadline task must be completed by a specific date.

To add a deadline, type: `deadline TASK_DESCRIPTION /by DATE`. For example, `deadline Finish Math HW /by Mon`

```
Got it. I've added this task: 
   [D][ ] Finish Math HW (by: Mon)
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

### 3.3 Adding an Event

An event task occurs over a period of time.

To add an event, type: `event TASK_DESCRIPTION /from START /to END`. For example, `event Project Meeting /from Thu 3pm /to 5pm`.

```
Got it. I've added this task: 
   [E][ ] Project Meeting (from: Thu 3pm to: 5pm)
Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
```

## 4. Listing All Tasks

To see all tasks in your list, use the `list` command.

```
Here are the tasks in your list: 
1. [T][ ] Buy toothpaste
2. [D][ ] Finish Math HW (by: Mon)
3. [E][ ] Project Meeting (from: Thu 3pm to: 5pm)
```

If there are no tasks:

```
No tasks yet.
```

## 5. Deleting Tasks

To remove a task, type: `delete TASK_NUMBER`. For example, `delete 1`.

```
OK. I've deleted this task: 
   [T][ ] Buy toothpaste
Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

## 6. Marking a Task as Done

Once you complete a task, you can mark it as done.

You can mark a task by typing: `mark TASK_NUMBER`. For example, `mark 2`.

```
Nice! I've marked this task as done: 
   [E][X] Project Meeting (from: Thu 3pm to: 5pm)
```

## 7. Unmarking a Task

If you accidentally mark a task as done, you can undo it.

To do so, type: `unmark TASK_NUMBER`. For example, `unmark 2`.

```
OK, I've marked this task as not done yet: 
   [E][ ] Project Meeting (from: Thu 3pm to: 5pm)
```

## 8. Finding Tasks by Keyword

To search for a task by keyword, use the `find` command.

Type `find KEYWORD`. For example, `find Math`.

```
Here are the matching tasks in your list:
1.[D][ ] Finish Math HW (by: Mon)
```

If no tasks match:

```
No matching tasks found.
```

## 9. Handling Invalid Commands

If an invalid command is entered, Monkey will notify you.

For example, type `randomCommand`.

```
Oh no! I do not understand the command.
```

## 10. Task Storage

Monkey automatically saves your tasks to a file. Your task list will be available when you restart the program.
